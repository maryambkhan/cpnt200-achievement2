### Requirements

Braggers golf
For this project I have chosen to do my family's golf simulator buisness because the curently use square space and hate every second of using it so i would like to build them one they have have full control over. I am hoping to be able to edit pretty much everything for them to make it easier for them from building and colouring the actual web page to making it use able to book appointments online. 

    This screenshot shows basically how I would want to set their website up, make sure you see an instant big book now button and also show off the inside of the building so customers see what they are going to.
I am going to need buttons and background images. I'm not too sure what else to be added as it doesnt need to be an over the top design just enough to make people want to click and book appointments with us.

title- Button - Background image

### Notes
 
- Requirement is just (open ended) i am not sure how to put it.
- Like at the end it says (title, button, background image) 
- It was not clear what you mean by `title` so i just added nav bar
and i assume it is a landing page and the client wants  to make sure people can clearly see 
`button`.
  
### Planing

- Page Layout
  - Navigation 
    - Logo(image)
    - Home (link)
    - Food and drinks(link)
    - Call to action (button)
  - Body
     - Sub Title (text)
     - Contact
     - Background Image (assets)
     - Call to Action Button (block)

- As client wanted the users to drew there attention toward booking. So i added two buttons on page to complete the requirement.
But in my opinion the button on navigation bar dont look good atleast to me.

### Problems

- I did not faced any major problems.
- Just small things like i created a component and when decided to put it together i realized its not going well together or thats now i wanted to put 
  it on page so went back recreated in a way that works for me.
- Somethings were same the work i have done before so i just used some of my old components like `nav-links`.
   Overall it was ok.
